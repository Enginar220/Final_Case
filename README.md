In this repo I've shared  my notebook that is about 1.6 million UK traffic accidents data which is taken from kaggle,
you can reach the data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales

I have done some descriptive data analysis,namely,I asked some questions like;
-Where do accidents generally happen in the given time period and place?
-Do whether/road condition affect the accidents rate 
etc.
